				<p>Before we start programming, we have to talk about algorithms, after all they represent the core of any program.
				<br>However, algorithms are specifically restricted to programming, in fact, we also can follow specific algorithms as human beings.
				<br>Let us take a look at a simple example.
				<br><img src="../images/ch1_atm.png" alt="ATM. Source: https://pixabay.com/">
				
				<p>When withdrawing money from an ATM, we have to follow a specific set of steps, for example:
				<ol>
					<li>Insert your debit card.</li>
					<li>Choose or enter the amount of money to withdraw.</li>
					<li>Choose the denomination.</li>
					<li>Enter your PIN.</li>
					<li>Take your card and money.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>Sounds about right, as a human being we will have no trouble following these steps.
				<br>However, a machine will have difficulties executing this algorithm, since there is at least one ambiduous step.
				<br>Step 2 tells us to choose a pre-set amount or enter the amount of cash, leaving this decision to the user.
				<br>A machine does not know which option to take, so we have to specify it further:
				<ol>
					<li>Insert your debit card.</li>
					<li>Choose the withdraw option.</li>
					<li>If desired, enter a specific value, go to 5.</li>
					<li>Select one of the pre-set values.</li>
					<li>If desired, choose the denomination.</li>
					<li>Enter your PIN, if correct go to 8.
					<li>Go to 6.</li>
					<li>Take your card and money.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>As we can see, we have added a couple of weird sounding steps, especially when it comes to go to instructions.
				<br>We have also removed the ambiguity from the previous algorithm.
				<br>Of course, these steps are still heavily abstracted and we may need to specify them further, but we won't go there yet.
				<br>What we need to know now, machines cannot think the way humans do, unlike machines we are capable of abstract thinking.
				<br>When programming a machine however, we have to define every step at lower levels of abstractions.
				<br>Thankfully, modern programming languages work at a relative high level, so in most cases we don't have to address the hardware directly.
				
				<p>So what is an algorithm in the context of Computer Science?
				<br>An algorithms is a finite, unambiguous sequence of strict, executable instructions which solve a specific problem.
				<br>Meaning, that when we encounter a problem, e.g. <b>How do I withdraw money from an ATM</b>, we have an abstract definition of said problem.
				<br>We then need to formulate an algorithm to solve that problem similarly how we did it before.
				<br>And then we can start translating the algorithm into a program using a programming language.
				<br>There is a lot more to algorithms and their properties, but we are here to program and not talk about dry mathematical theory, aren't we?

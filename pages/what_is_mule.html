		<h1>What is MuLE?</h1>
		<p>MuLE, which is an acronym for a <b>Mu</b>ltiparadgim <b>L</b>anguage for <b>E</b>ducation, is a programming language developed specifically for teaching programming to beginners.
		<br>Why not use Java or Python or any other existing programming language instead?
		<br>Well, some of these languages like Java had grown tremendously over time and are way too complex, especially for beginners.
		<br>Simpler languages like Python on the other hand tend to abstract important concepts, which may be useful for professionals, but can be detrimental when trying to teach these concepts to beginners.
		<br>Finally, other existing educational languages are either obsolete or are too focused on a specific programming paradigm. MuLE supports procedural, object-oriented and functional programming.
		</p>
		<p>The purpose of this website is to give you an overview over our language as well as offer you a guide to get started with the language.
		<br>Furthermore, this website includes a programming course based on MuLE. The couse is designed to help you get into programming and learn specifics of the three supported paradigms.
		<br>Once you get familiar with the concepts, moving on to a different programming language based on these concepts will be easier.

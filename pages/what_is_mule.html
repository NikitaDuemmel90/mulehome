		<h1>What is MuLE?</h1>
		<p>Since the emergence of object-oriented programming, the educational facilities have stopped using programming languages specifically designed for the purpose of education and are relying on professionally used languages instead. Even though it is understandable why this is the case, after all, sooner or later the students will be confronted with these languages, we are arguing that using complex professional languages in introductory programming education can be detrimental. These languages are designed with different priorities in mind than what is really important at the start of education. Furthermore, their complexity can act overwhelming for beginner programmers and the tendency towards implicit behaviour among some of these languages can be a cause for unnecessary misconceptions. Thus, it is our opinion that a language specifically designed with education in mind is required when teaching programming.

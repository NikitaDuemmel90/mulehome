		<h1>Programming with MuLE</h1>
		<p>As mentioned, MuLE is a language designed to be used in programming education, being easier as Java and less abstract than Python.
		<br>The purpose of the following programming course is to teach you basic programming skills and foundations of procedural, object-oriented and functional programming.
		<br>You will be given a set of examples, simply copy the example code into your Eclipse and run it to see what it does.
		
		<p>In chapter one we will take a look at algorithms and learn simple imperative programming, such as data and their types, printing our name on the console or the purpose of variables as well as simple arithmetic.
		<br>The next chapter will introduce truth values and control flow, i.e. manipulating the flow of our program depending on specific conditions.
		<br>In the third chapter we will define our own data types as enumerations and compositions of values.
		<br>Chapter four introduces us to procedural programming by discussing operations.
		<br>The topic of reference types and object-oriented programming is discussed in the fifth chapter by combining the concepts of the previous two chapters.
		<br>And the topic of the final chapter is recursion and functional programming.

			<h3 id="algorithms"><li>Algorithms</h3>
				<p>Before we start programming, we have to talk about algorithms, after all they represent the core of any program.
				<br>However, algorithms are specifically restricted to programming, in fact, we also can follow specific algorithms as human beings.
				<br>Let us take a look at a simple example.
				<br><img src="../images/ch1_atm.png" alt="ATM. Source: https://pixabay.com/">
				
				<p>When withdrawing money from an ATM, we have to follow a specific set of steps, for example:
				<ol>
					<li>Insert your debit card.</li>
					<li>Choose or enter the amount of money to withdraw.</li>
					<li>Choose the denomination.</li>
					<li>Enter your PIN.</li>
					<li>Take your card and money.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>Sounds about right, as a human being we will have no trouble following these steps.
				<br>However, a machine will have difficulties executing this algorithm, since there is at least one ambiduous step.
				<br>Step 2 tells us to choose a pre-set amount or enter the amount of cash, leaving this decision to the user.
				<br>A machine does not know which option to take, so we have to specify it further:
				<ol>
					<li>Insert your debit card.</li>
					<li>Choose the withdraw option.</li>
					<li>If desired, enter a specific value, go to 5.</li>
					<li>Select one of the pre-set values.</li>
					<li>If desired, choose the denomination.</li>
					<li>Enter your PIN, if correct go to 8.
					<li>Go to 6.</li>
					<li>Take your card and money.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>As we can see, we have added a couple of weird sounding steps, especially when it comes to go to instructions.
				<br>The go to instructions allow us to skip some steps or repeat previous steps depending on a specific condition.
				<br>This way we have removed the ambiguity from the previous algorithm.
				<br>Of course, these steps are still heavily abstracted and we may need to specify them further, but we won't go there yet.
				<br>What we need to know now, machines cannot think the way humans do, unlike machines we are capable of abstract thinking.
				<br>When programming a machine however, we have to define every step at lower levels of abstractions.
				<br>Thankfully, modern programming languages work at a relatively high level, so in most cases we don't have to address the hardware directly.
				
				<p>So what is an algorithm in the context of Computer Science?
				<br>An algorithms is a finite, unambiguous sequence of strict, executable instructions which solve a specific problem.
				<br>Meaning, that when we encounter a problem, e.g. <b>How do I withdraw money from an ATM</b>, we have an abstract definition of said problem.
				<br>We then need to formulate an algorithm to solve that problem similarly how we did it before.
				<br>And then we can start translating the algorithm into a program using a programming language.
				<br>There is a lot more to algorithms and their properties, but we are here to program and not talk about dry mathematical theory, aren't we?

			<h3 id="hwprogram"><li>A "Hello, world!" program</h3>
				<p>If you have followed the getting started guide, you have propably already written and executed you first "Hello, World!" program.
				<br>If you have not, we strongly suggest that you do it now.

				<p>There is quite a lot of information in this example, so let us try to summarize it:
				<ol>
					<li>A program is written in a file, its name must be equal to the file name.</li>
					<li>We can import libraries, which are contained in their own files, using their names in an <b>import</b> instruction.</li>
					<li>Named elements, e.g. a program or a variable, can be referred to by theit names. In this example we first refer to the <b>IO</b> library to import it, then again to access the <b>writeString</b> operation, which we also reference by its own name.</li>
					<li>The main procedure is the entry point in our program, i.e. the first statement here is the first one to be executed.</li>
					<li>A statement is a single executable instruction with a specific task, e.g. the <b>IO.writeString("Hello, world!")</b> invokes the imported operation to print a string on the console. 
					<br>Other statements can be used to declare variables, change their values or manipulate to flow of our program depending on specific conditions.
					</li>
					<li>Statements can be complemented by expressions, which in case of MuLE cannot be used outside of statements. An expression is evaluated and yields a value.
					<br>In our case <b>"Hello, World!"</b> is an expression which is used to pass a string value to the <b>writeString</b> operation. Another example of an expression is <b>2 + 3</b> which yields 5.
					</li>
					<li>Values represent data. They also have a data type, which is used to validate the correctness of our program.
					<br>In our example we invoke an operation which expects a string value, meaning that we are not allowed to pass a value with a different data type, e.g. an integer.
					<br>So if we want to print a <b>5</b> using <b>writeString</b>, we have to pass it as a string value, i.e. <b>"5"</b>.
					<br>Otherwise our program will not compile.
					</li>
					<li>We can define our own operations and types outside of the main procedure, which we will do it in subsequent chapters.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>Comments are a very useful feature, as the name suggests, they are meant to be used to write comments for your code.
				<br>Even if you understand now, what you code is doing, if you look at it in a couple of weeks or even months, you will have to invest time to understand you own program.
				<br>If you write meaningful comments for you programs, both your future self as well as your colleagues will be very grateful.

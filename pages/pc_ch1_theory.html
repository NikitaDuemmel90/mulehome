			<h3 id="algorithms"><li>Algorithms</h3>
				<p>Before we start programming, we have to talk about algorithms, after all they represent the core of any program.
				<br>However, algorithms are specifically restricted to programming, in fact, we also can follow specific algorithms as human beings.
				<br>Let us take a look at a simple example.
				<br><img src="../images/ch1_atm.png" alt="ATM. Source: https://pixabay.com/">
				
				<p>When withdrawing money from an ATM, we have to follow a specific set of steps, for example:
				<ol>
					<li>Insert your debit card.</li>
					<li>Choose or enter the amount of money to withdraw.</li>
					<li>Choose the denomination.</li>
					<li>Enter your PIN.</li>
					<li>Take your card and money.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>Sounds about right, as a human being we will have no trouble following these steps.
				<br>However, a machine will have difficulties executing this algorithm, since there is at least one ambiduous step.
				<br>Step 2 tells us to choose a pre-set amount or enter the amount of cash, leaving this decision to the user.
				<br>A machine does not know which option to take, so we have to specify it further:
				<ol>
					<li>Insert your debit card.</li>
					<li>Choose the withdraw option.</li>
					<li>If desired, enter a specific value, go to 5.</li>
					<li>Select one of the pre-set values.</li>
					<li>If desired, choose the denomination.</li>
					<li>Enter your PIN, if correct go to 8.</li>
					<li>Go to 6.</li>
					<li>Take your card and money.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>As we can see, we have added a couple of weird sounding steps, especially when it comes to go to instructions.
				<br>The go to instructions allow us to skip some steps or repeat previous steps depending on a specific condition.
				<br>This way we have removed the ambiguity from the previous algorithm.
				<br>Of course, these steps are still heavily abstracted and we may need to specify them further, but we won't go there yet.
				<br>What we need to know now, machines cannot think the way humans do, unlike machines we are capable of abstract thinking.
				<br>When programming a machine however, we have to define every step at lower levels of abstractions.
				<br>Thankfully, modern programming languages work at a relatively high level, so in most cases we don't have to address the hardware directly.
				
				<p>So what is an algorithm in the context of Computer Science?
				<br>An algorithms is a finite, unambiguous sequence of strict, executable instructions which solve a specific problem.
				<br>Meaning, that when we encounter a problem, e.g. <b>How do I withdraw money from an ATM</b>, we have an abstract definition of said problem.
				<br>We then need to formulate an algorithm to solve that problem similarly how we did it before.
				<br>And then we can start translating the algorithm into a program using a programming language.
				<br>There is a lot more to algorithms and their properties, but we are here to program and not talk about dry mathematical theory, aren't we?

			<h3 id="hwprogram"><li>A "Hello, world!" program</h3>
				<p>If you have followed the getting started guide, you have propably already written and executed you first "Hello, World!" program.
				<br>If you have not, we strongly suggest that you do it now.
				<br><img src="../images/ch1_hw.png" alt="">
				
				<p>There is quite a lot of information in this example, so let us try to summarize it:
				<ol>
					<li>A program is written in a file, its name must be equal to the file name.</li>
					<li>We can import libraries, which are contained in their own files, using their names in an <b>import</b> instruction.</li>
					<li>Named elements, e.g. a program or a variable, can be referred to by theit names. In this example we first refer to the <b>IO</b> library to import it, then again to access the <b>writeString</b> operation, which we also reference by its own name.</li>
					<li>The main procedure is the entry point in our program, i.e. the first statement here is the first one to be executed.</li>
					<li>A statement is a single executable instruction with a specific task, e.g. the <b>IO.writeString("Hello, world!")</b> invokes the imported operation to print a string on the console. 
					<br>Other statements can be used to declare variables, change their values or manipulate to flow of our program depending on specific conditions.
					</li>
					<li>Statements can be complemented by expressions, which in case of MuLE cannot be used outside of statements. An expression is evaluated and yields a value.
					<br>In our case <b>"Hello, World!"</b> is an expression which is used to pass a string value to the <b>writeString</b> operation. Another example of an expression is <b>2 + 3</b> which yields 5.
					</li>
					<li>Values represent data. They also have a data type, which is used to validate the correctness of our program.
					<br>In our example we invoke an operation which expects a string value, meaning that we are not allowed to pass a value with a different data type, e.g. an integer.
					<br>So if we want to print a <b>5</b> using <b>writeString</b>, we have to pass it as a string value, i.e. <b>"5"</b>.
					<br>Otherwise our program will not compile.
					</li>
					<li>We can define our own operations and types outside of the main procedure, which we will do it in subsequent chapters.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>Comments are a very useful feature, as the name suggests, they are meant to be used to write comments for your code.
				<br>Even if you understand now, what you code is doing, if you look at it in a couple of weeks or even months, you will have to invest time to understand you own program.
				<br>If you write meaningful comments for you programs, both your future self as well as your colleagues will be very grateful.

			<h3 id="datatypes"><li>Data and Data Types</h3>
				<p>The word informatics is an amalgam of two words: infortmaion and mathematics. Or in other words, informatics is built around data and what we can do with it.
				<br>Thus the core idea of any program is usually to handle chunks of <b>data</b>, and in order to know what to do, each piece of information has a <b>data type</b>.
				<br>Let's take a look at the following program, feel free to copy and paste the code into your Eclipse and run it.
				<p>
				<textarea rows="10" cols="150" readonly>
program dataAndTypes
import IO

main
	IO.writeString("Hi")		IO.writeLine()
	IO.writeInteger(42)		IO.writeLine()
	IO.writeRational(3.14)		IO.writeLine()
	IO.writeBoolean(true)		IO.writeLine()
endmain
				</textarea>
				<p>As we can see, we print different values on the console and we need different operations for different types of values.
				<br>We can not print an integer using the <b>writeString</b> operation since it expects a string value as a parameter.
				
				<p>MuLE supports four basic data types:
				<ul>
					<li><b>string</b> - represents strings of characters, such as <i>"Hi"</i> or <i>"Hello, world!"</i>.</li>
					<li><b>integer</b> - are our basic numbers, e.g. <i>42</i> or <i>5</i>.</li>
					<li><b>rational</b> - represents the floating point numbers, for example <i>3.14</i> or <i>5.5555</i>.</li>
					<li><b>boolean</b> - for truth values which are <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a>

			<p><br>
			<h3 id="variables"><li>Variables</h3>
				<p>The concept of variables should sound familiar, pretty sure most of us have heard it in the mathematics class.
				<br>In the mathematics variables represent placeholders for values, e.g. in <i>f(x) = mx + t</i> we have three variables, with <i>x</i> also acting as a parameter.
				<br>In most programming languages, variables act as a named container for values, i.e. we can store our data there.
				<br>The image below gives an extremely simplified explanation of variables in the memory of a program, i.e. we have a container with the name <b>x</b> where we can store integer values. The currently stored value is 42.
				<br><img src="../images/ch1_var.png" alt="">
				<p>The following code demonstrates the basic usage of variables, go ahead and try it out in your Eclipse.

program variables
import IO

main
	variable str : string
	str := "Hello, world!"
	IO.writeString("string = ")		IO.writeString(str)		IO.writeLine()
	
	variable intgr : integer
	intgr := 42
	IO.writeString("integer = ")		IO.writeInteger(intgr)		IO.writeLine()
	
	variable ratnl : rational
	ratnl := 3.14
	IO.writeString("rational = ")		IO.writeRational(ratnl)		IO.writeLine()
	
	variable truthVal : boolean
	truthVal := true
	IO.writeString("truth value = ")	IO.writeBoolean(truthVal)	IO.writeLine()
endmain

			<h3 id="input"><li>User Input</h3>
				<p>When talking about our ATM algorithm at the beginning of this chapter, we have mentioned steps in which user had to enter her PIN or the amount of money.
				<br>This values are specific to each user, meaning that there should be a possibility for the user to enter this information and pass it to the machine.
				<br>To achieve this we use the <b>IO</b> library again, which we have already used to print values on the console.
				<br>This time we have to use one of the read operations, e.g. <b>readString</b> if we want to read a string value, which we will have to enter from the console view.
				<br>Please notice, that the read operation does not accept any parameters, unlike the write operations.
				<br>However it yields us a value, which we promptly store in a variable. We can now use this variable to access the data which we have entered earlier, for example to print it on the console.

			<h3 id="operators"><li>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
				<p>Arithmetic operators allow us to parforms basic arithmetic operations on numeric values, i.e. values of types <b>integer</b> and <b>rational</b>.
				<ul>
					<li><b>+</b> : addition</li>
					<li><b>-</b> : subtraction</li>
					<li><b>*</b> : multiplication</li>
					<li><b>/</b> : rational division</li>
					<li><b>div</b> : integer division</li>
					<li><b>mod</b> : modulo</li>
					<li><b>exp</b> : exponentiation</li>
				</ul>

	IO.writeString("5 + 2 = ")	IO.writeRational(5 + 2)		IO.writeLine()
	IO.writeString("5 - 2 = ")	IO.writeRational(5 - 2) 	IO.writeLine()
	IO.writeString("5 * 2 = ")	IO.writeRational(5 * 2) 	IO.writeLine()
	IO.writeString("5 / 2 = ")	IO.writeRational(5.0 / 2.0) 	IO.writeLine()

			<h3 id="concat"><li>String Concatenation</h3>
				<p>Similar to our arithmetic operations, we can apply a specific concatenation operator <b>& </b> on two strings to create a single string from them.
				<p>
				<textarea rows="17" cols="150" readonly>
program stringConcatenation
import IO

main	
	variable name : string
		
	IO.writeString("Please enter your name: ")
	name := IO.readString()
	
	// No longer:
	// IO.writeString("Hello ")
	// IO.writeString(name)
	
	// Instead we can write:	
	IO.writeString("Hello " & name)
endmain

			<h3 id="typeConversion"><li>Type Conversion</h3>
				<p>Sometimes we have the right data but with the wrong data type.
				<br>For example, we want to concatenate a number to a string value.
				<br>We can't simply do that using the concatenation operator since it expects two string values.
				<br>So first, we need to transform our number into a string.
				<br>We can do this by importing the <b>Strings</b> library and using some of its operations, for example <b>integerToString</b>.
				<p>
				<textarea rows="20" cols="150" readonly>
program typeConversion
import IO
import Strings	// import the Strings library

main
	variable item : string
	variable price : rational
	variable number : integer
	
	item := "apple"
	price := 0.5
	number := 3
	
	variable totalPrice : rational
	totalPrice := price * number
	
	IO.writeString("One " & item & " costs " & Strings.rationalToString(price) & "\n") // use Strings operations to convert non string data
	IO.writeString(Strings.integerToString(number) & " " & item & "(s) cost(s) " & Strings.rationalToString(totalPrice) & "\n") // into strings
endmain

			<h3 id="turtle"><li>Turtle</h3>
				<p>And as the final topic of this chapter, we will take a look at the Turtle library.
				<br>This library allows us to draw pictures programmatically, which, as we all know, is much more fun than computing arithmetic operations, isn't it.
				<br>To use the <b>Turtle</b> library, we have to import it first.
				<br>The library is very simple, we can draw lines using the <b>forward(LENGTH_PIXELS)</b> opeation and change our bearing using the <b>left(ANGLE)</b> or <b>right(ANGLE)</b> operations.
				<br>There are other operations of course, but we don't need them right now.

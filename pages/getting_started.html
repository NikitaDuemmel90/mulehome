			<h3 id="java"><li>Java</h3>
				<p>MuLE is powered by Java, which makes it platform independent, however you need to have at least Java 8 running on your machine.
				<br>If you are not sure if Java is already installed and which version you have, you can enter the command <b>java -version</b> in you command line interface, e.g. <b>cmd.exe</b> on Windows.
				<br><img src="../images/java_version.png" alt="Using java -version to check your Vava version in the CLI.">
				<br>You can get the current version of Java at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/" target="_blank">https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/</a>

			<p><br>
			<h3 id="eclipse"><li>Prepackaged Eclipse archives</h3>
				<p>The tool support for MuLE is provided by the Eclipse integrated development environment.
				<br>You can download prepackaged Eclipse from these links:
				<ul>
					<li>Windows: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9uPZpa_NvQPbMsPtKREsaLV5rlIix9z/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9uPZpa_NvQPbMsPtKREsaLV5rlIix9z/view?usp=sharing</a></li>
					<li>Linux: PLACEHOLDER</li>
					<li>macOS: PLACEHOLDER</li>
				</ul>
				Simply unpack the respective archive in any folder and you can move to the <a href="#eclipse">next step</a>.
				<p>However, if you want to download and configure your own Eclipse, instead of downloading any of the above erchives, you need to follow the <a href="#mule_install">installation instructions</a>.

			<p><br>
			<h3 id="eclipse_first_steps"><li>First steps in Eclipse</h3>
				<p>You have downloaded an Eclipse archive and extracted it in a folder of your choice.
				<ol>
					<li>
						Start Eclipse by running the executable (<b>eclipse.exe</b> on Windows)
					</li>
					<p>
					<li>
						Once Eclipse loads, you will see the following window:
						<br><img src="../images/eclipse_start_workspace.png" alt="Setting the Eclipse workspace path.">
						<br>Here you are asked to set a path to you workspace, i.e. a folder where all of your project folders and files will be stored.
						<br>Enter a path of your choice and press <b>Launch</b>.
					</li>
					<p>
					<li>
						You will be greeted by the following window:
						<br><img src="../images/eclipse_start_window.png" alt="Eclipse greeting window.">
						<br>Simply press the <b>Hide</b> button in the upper right corner and you will get to your workspace.
					</li>
					<p>
					<li>
						We are now in the Java perspective, which look like that:
						<br><img src="../images/eclipse_start_java.png" alt="Java perspective.">
						<br>Since we want to program using MuLE, we have to click on the <b>MuLE Project</b> option in the <b>Package Explorer</b>. 
						<br>Once we do that, a new window will open prompting us to enter the project name.
						<br>Let us enter <b>MyFirstProject</b> as a name and press <b>Finish</b>.
						<br>Keep in mind, some names will not be accepted, e.g. you may not use empty spaces within a name or use most special characters.
						<br>If you now browse to your workspace folder in your system explorer, you will find your new project folder there.
						<br>You may also have noticed, that the main window in the background has changed slightly.
					</li>
					<p>
					<li>
						Creating a MuLE project has automatically forced us into the MuLE Perspective, we can see fewer buttons compared to the Java perspective.
						<br><img src="../images/eclipse_start_mule_empty.png" alt="MulE perspective, empty project.">
						<br>As we can see, the project is empty, we have to create a MuLE file first.
						<br>To do this, right click on the <b>src</b> folder in your project and select <b>New &rarr; File &rarr; Other &rarr; MuLE &rarr; MuLE File</b>, enter the file name, e.g. <b>HW</b>, and press <b>Finish</b>.
						<br>Keep in mind, some names will not be accepted, e.g. you may not use empty spaces within a name or use most special characters.
						<br>Alternatively, you can click on <b>File &rarr; New &rarr; MuLE File</b> and enter the target src folder as well as a name.
					</li>
					<p>
					<li>
						As tradition demands, we will start by writing a <b>Hello, world!</b> program.
						<br>To do this, simply type <b>IO.writeString("Hello, world!")</b> somewhere between the keywords <b>main</b> and <b>endmain</b>.
						<br>Once you are done typing, save your file and press the green button which looks like a PLAY button.
						<br>You should see a <b>Hello, world!</b> output in the console view.
						<br><img src="../images/eclipse_start_mule_hw.png" alt="Hello, world!">
						<br>That's it, we have written our first MuLE program!
						<br>You can now start with the programming course, everything you need to know will be explained there step-by-step.
						<br>A structured overview over specific language constructs is given in the corresponding sections of this website.

			<h3 id="mule_install"><li>Installing MuLE on a clean Eclipse</h3>
				<p>Follow these steps <b>ONLY</b> if you have chosen not to use one of the <a href="#eclipse">prepackaged Eclipse archives</a>. 
				<br><b>ATTENTION:</b> the MuLE plugins make changes to the Eclipse user interface. You are advised to use a separate Eclipse installation for MuLE.
				<ol>
					<li>Download an Eclipse package (Eclipse IDE for Java Developers will suffice): <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/" target="_blank">https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/</a></li>
						<br><img src="../images/eclipse_download.png" alt="Choose Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.">
					<li>Extract the archive in the folder of your choice and run the executable.</li>
					<li>Once Eclipse has started, navigate to <b>Help &rarr; Install new Software</b>.</li>
					<li>Copy and paste the following address into the <b>Work with</b> field and press enter: <a href="http://132.180.192.13/mule/update/" target="_blank">http://132.180.192.13/mule/update/</a>
					<li>Select the MuLE plugin</li>
					<li>(Optional) Activate the option <b>Contant all update sites during install to find required software</b>.
					<br>This step is required if you encounter an error message during the install process.
					</li>
					<li>Press <b>Next</b>, a new window will open, press <b>Next</b> again.</li>
					<li>Accept the (non-existing) license, press <b>Finish</b>. Press <b>Install Anyway</b>.</li>
					<li>Once the installation is complete, restart Eclipse. MuLE is now installed and can be used.</li>
					<li>Navigate to <b>Help &rarr; Check for Updates</b> to update MuLE as well as all other plugins.

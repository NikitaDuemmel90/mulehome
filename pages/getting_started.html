		<h1>Getting started</h1>		
		<p>This guide will explain everything you need to start programming with MuLE.	
		
		<h3>Java</h3>
		<p>MuLE is powered by Java, which makes it platform independent, however you need to have at least Java 8 running on your machine.
		<br>If you are not sure if Java is already installed, you can enter the command <i>java -version</i> in you command line interface, e.g. <i>cmd.exe</i> on Windows.

		<h3>Eclipse</h3>
		<p>The tool support for MuLE is provided by the Eclipse integrated development environment.

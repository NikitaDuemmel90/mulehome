		<h1>Getting started</h1>		
		<p>This guide will explain everything you need to start programming with MuLE.	
		
		<p><br><h3>Java</h3>
		<p>MuLE is powered by Java, which makes it platform independent, however you need to have at least Java 8 running on your machine.
		<br>If you are not sure if Java is already installed, you can enter the command <b>java -version</b> in you command line interface, e.g. <b>cmd.exe</b> on Windows.
		<br><img src="../images/java_version.png" alt="Using java -version to check your Vava version in the CLI.">
		<br>You can get the current version of Java at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/" target="_blank">https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/</a>
		
		<p><br><h3>Eclipse</h3>
		<p>The tool support for MuLE is provided by the Eclipse integrated development environment.
		<br>You can download prepackaged Eclipse from these links:
		<ul>
			<li>Windows: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9uPZpa_NvQPbMsPtKREsaLV5rlIix9z/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9uPZpa_NvQPbMsPtKREsaLV5rlIix9z/view?usp=sharing</a></li>
			<li>Linux: PLACEHOLDER</li>
			<li>macOS: PLACEHOLDER</li>
		</ul>
		Simply unpack the respective archive in any folder and you can skip to the next step.
		<p>However, if you want to download and configure your own Eclipse, instead of downloading any of the above erchives, you need to follow the instructions <a href="#mule_install">here</a>.
		
		
		<p><br><h3 id="mule_install">Installing MuLE on a clean Eclipse</h3>
		<p>Follow these steps ONLY if you have chose not to use one of the prepackaged Eclipse archives. 
		<br><b>ATTENTION:</b> the MuLE plugins make changes to the Eclipse user interface. You are advised to use a separate Eclipse installation for MuLE.
